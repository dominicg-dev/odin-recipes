This project is meant to show what I know about HTML coding (as of 10/24). The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.

Reflection: This project required methodical thinking and consistency. Even so, I did not think to use lists to break out the recipes on the Index. Still the sites came out as I hoped they would.
