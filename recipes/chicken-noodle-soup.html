            <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Easy to make chicken noodle soup with the basics.</p>
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
                <li>1 pound ground chicken</li>
                <li>Salt and black pepper</li>
                <li>4 garlic cloves, roughly chopped</li>
                <li>1 1/2 teaspoons ground coriander</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon celery seeds (optional)</li>
                <li>2 celery stalks, halved lengthwise, then sliced 1/2-inch thick</li>
                <li>1 large carrot, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch cubes</li>
                <li>1 large shallot, finely chopped</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves (or 1 teaspoon dried thyme leaves)</li>
                <li>7 to 8 cups chicken stock, plus more as needed</li>
                <li>8 ounces dried egg noodles, cavatelli or other small shaped pasta</li>
                <li>Creme fraiche, chopped fresh parsley and dill, and lemon zest, for garnish</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>In a large pot, heat 3 tablespoons oil over medium-high. Add the chicken, season generously with salt and pepper, and cook, breaking up with a wooden spoon, until starting to crumble, about 3 minutes. Add the garlic, coriander and celery seeds (if using), and cook, stirring frequently, until chicken is cooked through, about 2 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, scoop the chicken into a small lidded bowl (to retain moisture); cover and set aside.</li>
                <li>Add the celery, carrot, shallot, thyme and the remaining 2 tablespoons oil to the pot, season with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring, until slicked with fat, 3 minutes. Add the stock (7 cups for a stewlike soup or up to 8 cups for a brothy soup) and bring to a boil over high.</li>
                <li>Add noodles and cook over medium-high until al dente according to package directions. (If the noodles absorb a lot of liquid, add more broth according to taste.) Add the reserved chicken and any accumulated juices and heat until warmed, then season to taste with salt and pepper. Divide among bowls; top with a spoonful of creme fraiche, a fistful of torn herbs and lemon zest.</li>
            </ol>
